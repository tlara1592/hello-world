# hello-world
This is my first Repository

My name is Terence

I was enlisted in the United States Marine Corp from 2003-2007.
I completed three tours in Iraq. My wife and I had our first child in January of 08, this was my motivation not to reenlist, instead to pursue an education to better my family.
After community college, and other training, I am now a student at the University of Phoenix.
I am currently enrolled in the software development program.
As long as everything goes as planned, I will graduate in April of 2017!

I decided to start something as a hobby in technology as a way to better my technical knowledge and skills.
